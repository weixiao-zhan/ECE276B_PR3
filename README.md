# UCSD ECE276B PR3

## Overview
In this assignment, you will implement a controller for a car robot to track a trajectory.

## Dependencies
This starter code was tested with: python 3.10, matplotlib 3.9.0, and numpy 1.26.4.

## Starter code
### 1. main.py
This file contains examples of how to generate control inputs from a simple P controller and apply the control on a car model. This simple controller does not work well. Your task is to replace the P controller with your own controller using CEC and GPI as described in the project statement.

### 2. utils.py
This file contains code to visualize the desired trajectory, robot's trajectory, and obstacles.

### 3. cec.py
This file provides skeleton code for the CEC algorithm (Part 1 of the project).

### 4. gpi.py
This file provides skeleton code for the GPI algorithm (Part 2 of the project).

### 5. value_function.py
This file provides skeleton code for the value function used by the GPI algorithm (Part 2 of the project).
